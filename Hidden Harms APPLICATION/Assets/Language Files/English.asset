  FGM_Facts:
  - Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) is the procedure of female genital organs being
    deliberately cut or injured, although there is no medical reason for this to be
    done.
  - "FGM is very painful and seriously harmful to the female\u2019s both short- and
    long-term health. Some girls die from blood loss or infection as a direct result
    of the procedure. Other consequences include: constant pain, repeated infections,
    bleeding, cysts and abscesses, problems passing urine or incontinence, depression,
    flashbacks, self-harm and childbirth problems sometimes leading to death. "
  - 'FGM is carried out on girls of all ages but usually occurs before the age of
    15 years and may be more common between the ages of 5 and 10. '
  - FGM is also known as female circumcision or cutting. Terms in other languages
    include sunna, gudniin, halalays, tahur, megrez and khitan among other names.
  - FGM is illegal. It is a form of child abuse and must never be carried out either
    here or abroad. It is also illegal to arrange for a child to be taken abroad for
    the procedure or to help someone carry out FGM in any way. Anyone found guilty
    of this faces up to 14 years in prison and may also be made to pay a fine.
  - "FGM is practiced because it is perceived to: rid the family of bad luck/evil
    spirits, be aesthetically desirable, preserve a girl\u2019s virginity, be a tradition
    of family and/or community, make future child birth safer, uphold family honour,
    be a rite of passage into womanhood, make the girl more \u2018marriageable\u2019,
    be a religious obligation and cleanse and purify the girl among other myths."
  - It is estimated that 200 million females alive today have undergone FGM. Furthermore
    3 million are at risk of undergoing FGM each year
  - FGM is documented in 30 countries-mainly Africa followed by Middle east and Asia.
    Egypt, Sudan, Somalia, Mali, Sierra Leone, Eritrea, Djibouti, Guinea all have
    over 88%
  DA_Facts:
  - Domestic abuse can be defined as the occurrence, or pattern of occurrences, of
    violent behaviour by a partner, ex-partner or family member.
  - "Domestic abuse can include financial abuse. This involves the perpetrator using
    money to control a person\u2019s actions and freedom of choice. This can take
    away independence and leave them with no money for food or clothing. It can sometimes
    leave a person with debts built up by the perpetrator."
  - Domestic abuse can include coercive control. This is a pattern of intimidation,
    isolation and control using or threatening physical or sexual violence. It creates
    a sense of fear and deprives a person of their freedom. It is suggested that it
    is like being taken hostage.
  - Domestic abuse can include harassment and stalking. This is when a person becomes
    fixated with another and can be persistent with unwanted attention. They can damage
    property, spy and follow, make threats or try to make unwanted contact. This can
    be frightening and upsetting.
  - "Domestic abuse can include digital abuse. Online platforms, such as Facebook
    and Twitter, are being used increasingly to perpetrate domestic abuse. For example,
    photos and videos posted without consent. Additionally, GPS locators or spyware
    are used to track a person\u2019s whereabouts."
  - 'Domestic abuse can have long term effects on health and well-being. This can
    include asthma, epilepsy, digestive problems, migraines and skin disorders. It
    can also affect mental health and lead to alcohol or drug misuse. '
  - "Women are more likely to experience domestic abuse. Men are more likely to be
    perpetrators of domestic abuse. Although this abuse occurs regardless of a woman\u2019s
    race, religion, sexuality or disability, women from minority groups often face
    extra barriers when seeking support. "
  - "Forced marriage, female genital mutilation and honour crimes (violence, including
    murder, committed by people \u2018defending\u2019 their family\u2019s or community\u2019s
    reputation) are all perpetrated by family members and are therefore forms of domestic
    abuse"
