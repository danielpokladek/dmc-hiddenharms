  FGM_Facts:
  - Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) is the procedure of female genital organs being
    deliberately cut or injured, although there is no medical reason for this to be
    done.
  - "FGM is very painful and seriously harmful to the female\u2019s both short- and
    long-term health. Some girls die from blood loss or infection as a direct result
    of the procedure. Other consequences include: constant pain, repeated infections,
    bleeding, cysts and abscesses, problems passing urine or incontinence, depression,
    flashbacks, self-harm and childbirth problems sometimes leading to death. "
  - 'FGM is carried out on girls of all ages but usually occurs before the age of
    15 years and may be more common between the ages of 5 and 10. '
  - FGM is also known as female circumcision or cutting. Terms in other languages
    include sunna, gudniin, halalays, tahur, megrez and khitan among other names.
  - FGM is illegal. It is a form of child abuse and must never be carried out either
    here or abroad. It is also illegal to arrange for a child to be taken abroad for
    the procedure or to help someone carry out FGM in any way. Anyone found guilty
    of this faces up to 14 years in prison and may also be made to pay a fine.
  - "FGM is practiced because it is perceived to: rid the family of bad luck/evil
    spirits, be aesthetically desirable, preserve a girl\u2019s virginity, be a tradition
    of family and/or community, make future child birth safer, uphold family honour,
    be a rite of passage into womanhood, make the girl more \u2018marriageable\u2019,
    be a religious obligation and cleanse and purify the girl among other myths."
  - It is estimated that 200 million females alive today have undergone FGM. Furthermore
    3 million are at risk of undergoing FGM each year
  - FGM is documented in 30 countries-mainly Africa followed by Middle east and Asia.
    Egypt, Sudan, Somalia, Mali, Sierra Leone, Eritrea, Djibouti, Guinea all have
    over 88%
